Platform Boilerplate
============


Ideal
------------

To have 1 boilerplate that can build your app and run it any ware possible. You should only need this boilerplate if you want to run a MEAN stack.

Intro
------------

Boilerplate for an app that can be exported to all major platforms available, native mobile, web, desktop behind that is a node server connected to a mongodb. All done via a MEAN stack.

Tech spec
------------

So this is the tech spec so far - please add some input in the [issues][1] section

Basic (MEAN stack)
------------

* Mongodb
* Node server
* Angular
* Sass
* Html

Tools
------------

* [node-webkit][2] for compiling into native **desktop** application
* [ionic][3] for compiling into native **mobile** application
* [Gulp][4] as task runner


Further functionality
------------

It would be nice to have following things aswell

* [bower][5] for frontend dependencies management
* build-in support for authentication with facebook, twitter, github, google & linkin support (maybe utilize passportjs)
* CI could be [jenkins][6] or similar
* Javascript testing could be [Jasmine][7] or simliar
* In addition to javascript testing jshint would be nice
* ES6 support trough babel
* A yeoman generator to scaffold all of the code
* Deployment of some kind, i would love to use docker containers for this

### Deployment Setup 
I think this would be a nice setup please contribute in the issues section if you have suggestions - i would love to use docker containers for scalability.

* Docker(Container1)     
	* Mongodb      
* Docker(Container2) 
	* Node server
* Docker(Container3)
	* Frontend/Angular
* Ionic(Android/iOS/WindowsPhone)
	* Frontend/Angular
* NW(Windows/OS X/Linus)
	* Frontend/Angular
